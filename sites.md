<p>Foot launch pilots rated Club Pilot and above are most welcome to fly the sites listed in this guide. <strong>We do ask however, that on your first visit to any site, you persuade a member of the Mid-Wales Club to accompany you.</strong></p>
<p>Our sites are not suitable for speed-flying.</p>
<p>At some sites conditions on the ground can change as quickly as those in the air, and most are in clear view of the land owner. So where a site is marked closed or is otherwise restricted please be patient, there is usually an alternative available. Any flyable looking hills you see in our area are known to us and are either restricted or being held in reserve against losses elsewhere. <strong>Please do not fly any non-listed sites (even if accompanied by a member) without phoning a committee member first- there may be issues with these sites which haven't been made widely known and which only the committee are aware of.</strong></p>
<p>An important consideration for many of our sites is the fact that they are on agricultural land. In general, take extra care during the lambing season as the stock is easily disturbed and check with the site liaison/website to see if the site is temporarily closed. Lambing generally occurs between January and the end of April.</p>
<p><em><strong>DO NOT FLY OR LAND NEAR LIVESTOCK.</strong></em></p>
<p>Please note that some land owners require a car parking fee. Full membership is only Â£10 per year. You can  online and pay by Paypal. The PDF version of the Sites Guide has information not present on the website, including maps of the members only sites. Please click on the icons to open the site details. Clicking on the name will take you to the full description.</p>
